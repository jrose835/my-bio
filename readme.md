### About Me

I moved to Atlanta, GA from Philadelphia in the summer of 2019 in order to start a doctorate program in Genetics at Emory University.
Prior to that I spent several years working in the pharmaceutical industry in the monoclonal antibody manufacturing process development field ([see my linkedIn profile for details](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-r-rose-85b70023/)). In the meantime I've played around here and there with programming and open source as a hobby, especially when it comes to intersections with biology.

In 2020 I joined the lab of Dr. Jerry Boss studying genetic and epigenetic regulation of immune cells (T cells & B cells) in the context of immune memory and autoimmune diseases respectively. 

>#### My current goal is to learn how to become a "scientific data scientist"
>*Aka someone who has the skills and experience to effciently approach and analyze large genetic datasets with the right set of questions and tools to ultimately gain insights and answer interesting biological questions* 

### General  Interests (...a running list)

1. Science fiction
2. Craft Beer
3. Data visualization/data science
4. Practicing to someday compete in the "Sliced" competition =)
5. Gardening
6. Trees

### Scientific & Professional Interests/Projects
I try to gear my studies towards learning and applying computational or bioinformatic tools to big questions around genetics, immunology, and sequencing technologies--but with the eye of a former bench scientist. That includes exploring large, complex bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets using models or data visualzation principles...as well as appropriate domain knowledge that allows me to know how to frame my research questions. 

That's the plan so far at least! We'll see where my next path takes me!

In no particular order:

- Immunology
- Gene regulation 
- Bioinformatics
- Human Genetics
- Pharmaceuticals/Translational Research
- Single cell sequencing
- Autoimmunity
